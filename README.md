# Promises-and-Async-Await

### Promises
- Promise is an object that can be in one of these states: 
-> **fulfilled**: successfully got data;
-> **rejected**: failed to get data;
-> **pending**: waiting for answer

Promises are used to request data asynchronously, meaning that the program continues to run while we wait for the data to return - while the promise is pending.
You can have more than one promise pending - they load in parallel.
